# BoxPush-Grid-Game

This repository contains a simple grid-based puzzle game where you push boxes to their designated positions. The objective is to solve each level by strategically moving the boxes while navigating obstacles. I didn't focus on graphics too much and tried to learn javascript instead.

## Features

- Grid-based gameplay with a focus on puzzle-solving.
- Intuitive controls for movement and box pushing.

## Getting Started

1. Use the arrow keys to control the player character and push boxes.
2. Your goal is to push all boxes onto the target tiles to complete each level.
